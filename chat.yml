# What is the point of 'this' file?
# This file manages replacing characters/words in the Minecraft chat, however, commands will remain unaffected.

##

# Why was this feature moved out of the config?
# The reason for this moving the content into separate file was due to word lists may become very big, and difficult to moderate.  (Especially the Replace_List)

##

# Any way I may add 'smileys'?
# You can add custom smileys and other special characters here,
# but the file must be saved with UTF-8 encoding. 

##

# What editor should I use?
# Recommended "Notepad++" <http://notepad-plus-plus.org/> for editing.
# WordPad, Notepad and other 'word processing' (text editing) software have been known to cause issues!
